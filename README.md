# Pewlett-Hackard

## Overview of Project

Pewlett-Hackard is a large company, with thousands of employees. Many of whom are approaching retirement age. 
In order to aid Pewlett-Hackard with the upcoming "silver tsunami", information about retiring employees has been
pulled from their data. Using Postgres SQL, the number of people retiring by title has been counted. After that a list
of employees was created that would be eligilble to participate in a mentorship program, that would help train the next
generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees.
 
## Results

  	- There are over 70,000 employees who will be apporaching retierment age.
	- Over 25,000 of these employees hold Senior Engineer titles.
	- Over 24,000 of these employees hold Senior Staff titles.
	- There are just over 1,500 employees who would be eligible for the Mentorship Program.

## Summary

	- As the "silver tsunami" hits there will be 72,458 roles that will need to be filled.
	- With only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program, there will not be enough employees for the program.
	- Expanding the search of employees for the mentorship progarm  beyond employees born in 1965, to people
		in titles needed with a certain number years of experience could help fill the gap.
	- A query to count how many employees are eligible for the mentorship program by job title could, tell the company
		what specific job titles are in need of more mentor and which if any have enough.
